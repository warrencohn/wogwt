# About WOGWT #

### WOGWT brings GWT to WebObjects ###

The primary goal of WOGWT is to make it easy for WebObjects developers to use GWT in their projects. It does this by packaging the entire GWT distribution as a .framework and by providing a tool (wogwt-tool.jar) to take care of the details of adding WOGWT to an existing Wonder application.

### WOGWT may be buggy, but GWT is NOT! ###

There is very little in WOGWT that is required to make use of GWT in your applications; only one thing really--WOGWTScript--which adds GWT to a page. This means that you can use everything provided by GWT and ignore the rest of WOGWT and still reap huge benefits. This is good because GWT itself is VERY well-tested and reliable, while WOGWT is not (yet). But you can develop with confidence if you just stick to the standard GWT and core Java classes.

### GWT is included ###

WOGWT includes the entire GWT distribution for Mac OS X except the documentation and sample code. So there is no need to download a copy of GWT unless you would like the docs and samples.
The current version included is the GWT trunk just before 2.0 milestone 1.
